# Bark and Whine

Eating is living. You are a powerless but gutsy dog, to whom meat is good while oranges are harmful. You are able to bark and drive away the persons trying to give a food in a direction by holding down the spacebar and pressing the arrow keys.ã€€When you press the arrow keys without pressing the spacebar, you whine, and the persons trying to feed the meat in that direction will rush to you.

This is made by using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel/), a retro game engine for Python. It requires Python3 (version 3.6.8 or higher) and other packeges mentioned [here](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel/blob/master/README.md/).
